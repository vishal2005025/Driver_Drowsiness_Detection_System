SLEEP SAFE DRIVE would make sure that you don't fall asleep during your road journey. SLEEP SAFE DRIVE would be your perfect companion for all your journeys.

## Overviewüìå
The Sleep Safe Driver Drowsiness Detection System is a software-based solution aimed at enhancing road safety by alerting drivers when they show signs of drowsiness or fatigue while driving. This system utilizes computer vision techniques to monitor the driver's behavior and detect potential signs of drowsiness in real-time.

## Features‚ñ∂Ô∏è
- Real-time drowsiness detection using computer vision algorithms<br>
- Alerts drivers through visual and auditory cues when drowsiness is detected<br>
- Lightweight and easy to integrate into existing vehicle systems<br>
- Compatible with various hardware setups including webcams, infrared sensors, and embedded systems<br>

## How it Worksüìù 
The Sleep Safe Driver Drowsiness Detection System operates by analyzing facial features and monitoring the driver's behavior to identify signs of drowsiness. The system utilizes a combination of machine learning models and image processing techniques to track key indicators such as eye closure and yawning.
When the system detects potential signs of drowsiness, it triggers alerts to notify the driver and prompt them to take necessary precautions. These alerts can include visual warnings displayed on a dashboard-mounted screen or auditory signals through speakers in the vehicle.
